# Production-Line-Efficiency-Evaluation
This project focused on identifying performance issues in a warehouse production line using Excel.  I analyzed batch completion times, employee productivity, and downtime data from multiple sources. By using functions like XLOOKUP, SUMIFS, INDEX, and MATCH, I created a unified table and built a dashboard to visualize key insights.
