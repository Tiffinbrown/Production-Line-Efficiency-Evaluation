# Production-Line-Efficiency-Evaluation
This project focused on identifying performance issues in a warehouse production line using Excel.  I analyzed batch completion times, employee productivity, and downtime data from multiple sources. By using functions like XLOOKUP, SUMIFS, INDEX, and MATCH, I created a unified table and built a dashboard to visualize key insights.

# ðŸ“Š Key Steps & Insights: Analyze and Visualize
Built a dynamic pivot chart to measure and visualize employee efficiency based on their production times.

Identified top performers and those struggling to meet targets.

Conducted a root-cause analysis on downtime, revealing that 5 out of 13 factors accounted for over 80% of all downtime minutes.

Found that 3 of those 5 key issues were due to human error.

To better understand and communicate these findings, I developed a dashboard that breaks down:

1. Downtime by cause

2. Error types by employee

3. Overall performance distribution

# âœ… Recommendations: Production Efficiency Improvements.
Machine Adjustment Training for all operators.

Targeted Training for specific recurring errors tied to batch changeovers.

Preventive Maintenance Protocols and inventory level checks to reduce mechanical downtime.


This demonstrates how actionable insights can be derived from structured Excel analysis and translated into meaningful operational improvements.
